This is a public statement in response to a recent request I received, asking me to cease my activities related to visiting the Jacaranda FM studios and generating mobile apps and social media posts regarding Jacaranda FM events.<br /><br><br />I want to express that I am a devoted listener of Jacaranda FM and an avid fan of the station. Activities, both online and offline, have been driven by my genuine admiration and support for Jacaranda FM.<br /><br><br />I understand the concerns that have been raised and I assure everyone that my intentions have never been, and never will be, to cause any discomfort or harm to any staff members or to the reputation of Jacaranda FM. All my communications with the staff have been courteous and professional, and I have maintained a record of these communications across various platforms including WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and email.<br /><br><br />I respectfully state that the request to cease my activities is perceived by me as an infringement upon my constitutional rights as stipulated by the South African Constitution. The Constitution grants me the right to freedom of expression, which includes the freedom to receive or impart information or ideas. Additionally, under the Constitution, I have the right to enter Jacaranda FM competitions and freely attend Jacaranda FM events. I should also have full access to the Jacaranda FM public-facing facilities, like reception and waiting areas at the studios and offices.<br /><br><br />I believe that my activities, conducted respectfully and lawfully, fall under these constitutional rights. Furthermore, I am acting in line with common business principles by expressing my genuine appreciation and support for a brand I admire.<br /><br><br />I am open to a constructive dialogue if there are specific actions or behaviors that Jacaranda FM finds concerning. If there are particular aspects of my activities that you would like me to reconsider, I am willing to engage in a discussion to address these issues while respecting my rights as a citizen and a fan of Jacaranda FM.<br /><br><br />I am forced to address this matter in public as I do not have other available means to communicate, such as an email address or InMail on LinkedIn, to reach the appropriate parties at Jacaranda FM.<br /><br><br />I invite representatives from Jacaranda FM to reach out if they are open to this dialogue. I would be more than happy to arrange a suitable time for us to talk.<br /><br><br />Thank you for your understanding and for taking the time to address this matter. I look forward to a resolution to both the stationâ€™s concerns and my rights as a devoted listener and supporter.</span><span class="p"><strong>Kind regards,</strong></span><span class="p"><strong>Martin Myburgh</strong></span><span class="p"><br></span><span class="p"><em>Please note that the records of my communications with the staff of Jacaranda FM are available upon request.</em></span></p>
